      <p>
        LanternWave (“LanternWave,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed
        to protecting the privacy and safety of our users, especially
        children. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        disclose, and protect personal information when you use the
        LanternWave application, website, and related services.

      <h2>1. Age, Region, and Consent</h2>
      <p>
        Before creating an account, users must provide their date of
        birth and country or region of residence. This allows us to
        determine applicable privacy laws and whether parental or
        guardian consent is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a user is under the applicable age of digital consent,
        LanternWave does not collect or process personal information
        until verified parental or guardian consent is obtained.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not require children to provide real names, and we do not
        use behavioral advertising or profiling for child accounts.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

        Personal information is used only to operate the Service,
        ensure age-appropriate experiences, maintain security, and
